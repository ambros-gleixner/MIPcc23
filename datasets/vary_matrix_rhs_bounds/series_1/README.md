# MIPcc23: The MIP Workshop 2023 Computational Competition

This directory contains one series of 50 related mixed-integer programs built from a common formulation with varying input data.

## Properties of the Instance Series

- Number of variables: 27710 (400 binary, 400 integer, and 26910 continuous)
- Number of constraints: 16288
- Varying components: constraint coefficients for 96 constraints, right-hand side values, bounds on continuous variables, and objective function coefficients
